# vaccine-acceptance

This repository is my final project for the Fall 2021 course STAT-604 at the University of Michigan. I made minor updates in June 2022 to ensure that it still ran correctly.

Most data needed to reproduce the analysis is included in the repository, with the exception of the `CLEAN_PHSM.csv` file which can be downloaded freely from [this link](https://frontdoor-l4uikgap6gz3m.azurefd.net/NCOV_PHM/CLEAN_PHSM?$format=csv) and put into the folder `data/UN_PHSM`.
